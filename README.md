# Space_Science_Walkthroughs
Following Thomas Albin's "Space Science with Python" tutorial series: https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/SpaceScienceTutorial

The goal of this repository is to learn and demonstrate data science aptitude with Python. Visualizations and calculations in the domain of astronomy.

I DO NOT CLAIM TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WALKTHROUGHS, only to have followed them to to learn. Credit for the creation of the walkthrough source material belongs to Thomas Albin.
