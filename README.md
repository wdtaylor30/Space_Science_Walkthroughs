# Space_Science_Walkthroughs
*I did not create- nor do I claim to have created- the tutorials followed for*
*this portfolio project.*

This is a portfolio project demonstrating proficiency in applications of Python
for data science.

Though my undergraduate research is in political science, I enjoy learning about
the natural sciences in my free time.

The code in this repository was written following Thomas Albin's *Space Science*
*with Python* series of tutorials, found at this link:

https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/SpaceScienceTutorial

Skills Demonstrated:
* 2D visualization using matplotlib
* 3D visualization
* domain-specific computation
